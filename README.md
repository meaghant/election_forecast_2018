# Election Forecast 2018

Not quite a blue wave, but a blue impulse...

I predict that Democrats will win back the House by less than a 10-seat margin. This will not be clear until several days or weeks after the election, since many races will be much closer than usual. Some predicted blue races may swing red. However, backlash against President Trump and the deep pockets of many of this year's Democratic campaigns will translate into a win for Democrats. The prevailing energy in the country is one of civic engagement on both sides; the more who vote, the more Democratic the electorate looks.

The Senate, though, will remain Republican. President Trump's recent anti-immigrant rhetoric has escalated in recent weeks and will drive enough concerned right-leaning voters to safeguard the Senate majority. Strong Democratic efforts like  O'Rourke in Texas and Donnel in Indiana will come close but fall short.
