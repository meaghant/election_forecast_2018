# Election Forecast 2018

Not quite a blue wave, but a blue impulse...

I predict that Democrats will win back the House by less than a 10-seat margin. This may not be clear until several days or weeks after the election, since many races may be much closer than usual. Some predicted blue races may swing red. However, backlash against President Trump and the deep pockets of many of this year's Democratic campaigns will translate into a win for Democrats.

The Senate, though, will remain Republican. President Trump's recent anti-immigrant rhetoric has escalated in recent weeks and will drive concerned right-leaning voters to the polls.
